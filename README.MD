Peace.io was built in the interest of helping governments, corporations, and individual citizens avoid negative repercussions of conflicts by providing accurate ways of assessing the likelihood of impending conflict in order to protect their own self-interests.

Peace.io was built with Python, Flask,scikit-learn, BlackRock,IBM, MongoDB, MLab, and React.js.
Our project is a machine learning-driven predictive search tool for conflict analysis of every countryâ€™s unique socioeconomic and political past and present. It presents the chance of conflicts for a country and explains whether structural conditions, economic conditions, current events, or overall sentiment is the cause of such a future conflict. It also displays past economic trends of a country.
